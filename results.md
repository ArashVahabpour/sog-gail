**Videos**

This is a supplementary material of our paper [Diverse Imitation Learning via Self-Organizing Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03484.pdf). In these videos, we demonstrate the learned policy of SOG under different experiment setups: these policies mimic the diverse expert behaviors successfully and as we change the latent variable, the mode of the imitated behavior changes accordingly. 

- [**Half-Cheetah-Vel**](https://youtube.com/shorts/SBW2Nu-fisg): This video demonstrates that as the latent variable varies, the imitated behavior of SOG-BC for the HalfCheetah agent takes different velocities. Please refer to Section IV.B for more details.
- [**Fetch-Reach**](https://youtu.be/ecI9Phj5N0w):  This video demonstrates that the trajectories of the Fetch robotic arm for different samples of the latent variable. We observe that SOG-BC is able to control the robotic arm towards any point in the 3D space. Please refer to Section IV.B for more details.
- [**Humanoid**](https://youtube.com/shorts/7F431aCr4Q0?feature=share): The imitated policy of humanoid going towards various directions learned using SOG: we observe that the complex humanoid behaviors are learned perfectly. As the latent variable changes, the direction of the motion changes successfully. Please see Section IV.B and Fig 2 for details of the corresponding experiment.
